	<h2>I've Learned By Example</h2>
	<p>Throughout this site, I go through the design process of a few of my projects; I don't care if someone "steals" my ideas because this is how I learned how to draw; fold origami; use 3D modeling, drafting, graphic design, photo manupulation, and rendering software; and eventually how I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS to do this site.<br><br>If someone likes my work, I would like to share how I made it so they can duplicate it and expand on my ideas in order to create better stuff.</p>
	<hr class="major" />
	<h2>A "How To" For This Site</h2>
	<p>There are three main components to this site: the landing page, the portfolio pages, and the resume page. I read somewhere that visually appealing design comes in odd numbers; I also wanted to highlight my work through showing my projects and highlight my experience through the resume page.</p>
	<h3> <a href="portfolio">Portfolio</a> </h3>
	<p>Each project in the portfolio page is labeled with the title, its discipline, type, and award if applicable. Each project page contains additional information such as location, and size. Below this is an image or renders of the final piece and below the visuals is a summary of the design process.<br><br>Purpose can be "For Competition", "For Work", or "Just Bored". "For Work" means it was part of an internship or any other kind of paid experience. "Just Bored" means I was just bored. This is my hobby. These projects are ones where I had an idea outside of school or work and I made something to express myself. This website project is labeled "Just Bored" because I made this after my internship ended and before starting work in the fall. I wasn't technically bored but this was a nice way to spend my time to avoid boreness.<br><br>Although I mentioned that I wanted to show my material and go through the process of making it, the breakdowns in the project pages are not step-by-step guides; they are a summary of what I did.
	<h3> <a href="resume">Resume</a> </h3>
	<p>This is just an image of my resume with a link to download it. Because I want this page to be just that, I will explain how the design came to be here. <br><br>I began my resume with free templates that I found online. The first ones I found that I liked had images on them, like a mini-portfolio. I'm glad that template fell off after I looked at what I did the day after because images shouldn't go on resumes, at least not mine.<br><br>I finally found a resume that I liked on pinterest and I went with it. I copied the layout, I found similar fonts and added a navy blue color to the black and white template. This design lasted a few weeks before I made more changes. The fonts changed completely. I used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>  to find good-looking fonts and font combinations. I used <a href="https://www.pantone.com/">Pantone's</a> color of the year, Ultra Violet, as my new color. I learned about color psychology and realized violet not only looks royal, it symbolizes loyalty which is important to me. I plan on changing the color every year to reflect Pantone's color of the year, so I will enjoy 2018 as the year I reflect on the importance of loyalty.<br><br>The fonts in this resume changed again and the layout changed a bit, too after a few months. The violet color remained. The fonts of the latest iteration can be found in the resume page as well as the color I used.
